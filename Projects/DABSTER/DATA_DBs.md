# DABSTER - DBs Blueprint

## 1. Overview

DABSTER (Database-Augmented Boosted System for Tracking, Engaging, and Retrieving) is a comprehensive system designed to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), graph RAG, and agent memory (both short-term and long-term) using a microservices architecture. This system will leverage the Langchain ecosystem, utilizing Postgres for local relational data, NoSQL for flexible data storage, and vector databases for efficient similarity searches.

### 2.2 Components

1. **Client UI**: Web interface for user interactions
2. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
3. **Service Mesh**: Handles inter-service communication
4. **Service Registry**: Keeps track of available services
5. **Microservices**:
   - RAG Service
   - Graph RAG Service
   - Agent Memory Service
6. **Database Layer**:
   - Postgres DB
   - NoSQL DB
   - Vector DB

## 3. Database Setup

### 3.1 Postgres Database (Local)

- Purpose: Store structured data, relationships, and metadata
- Tables:
  - Documents
  - Entities
  - Relationships
  - User Data
  - System Configurations

### 3.2 NoSQL Database

- Purpose: Store semi-structured and unstructured data
- Collections:
  - Raw Document Content
  - Agent Interactions
  - Temporary Data Caches

### 3.3 Vector Database

- Purpose: Store and query vector embeddings for similarity search
- Collections:
  - Document Embeddings
  - Query Embeddings
  - Entity Embeddings

## 4. Microservices Breakdown

### 4.1 RAG Service
