Hello Langy, I hope this message finds you well. I've been working on modifying the `start_adapt_cameldev.ps1` script to address some issues we encountered while trying to run the ADAPT-CamelDEV project. Before I make any changes, I wanted to check with you first since you might be working on the same file.

Here are the changes I'm proposing:

1. Update the script to use correct paths relative to the ADAPT-CamelDEV-Project directory.
2. Add error handling for missing files (requirements.txt and app.py).
3. Improve the environment variable loading process.

Are you currently working on this file or have any ongoing changes that I should be aware of? If not, would you be okay with me implementing these updates?

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can coordinate our efforts to avoid any conflicts.
