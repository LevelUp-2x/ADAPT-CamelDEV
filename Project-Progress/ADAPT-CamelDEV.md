# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

## Current Status
We have set up the ADAPT-CamelDEV project repository and verified its status. The local repository is properly connected to the remote GitHub repository. However, we encountered issues with staging and committing recent changes.

## Completed Tasks
- Created a new directory for ADAPT-CamelDEV
- Copied relevant files from the original project
- Initialized a new Git repository
- Created and linked the GitHub repository (https://github.com/LevelUp-2x/ADAPT-CamelDEV.git)
- Made initial commits with project files
- Created scripts (check_git_status.py and git_helper.py) to verify Git status
- Verified the connection between local and remote repositories

## Current Repository Status
- The remote repository is correctly set up at https://github.com/LevelUp-2x/ADAPT-CamelDEV.git
- We're on the main branch, which is up to date with 'origin/main'
- Modified files not yet staged for commit:
  - Project Progress/ADAPT-CamelDEV.md
  - git_helper.py
- Untracked files:
  - check_git_status.py
  - git_status_output.txt
- The repository has two initial commits in its history

## Next Steps
1. Retry staging and committing the modified and untracked files:
   - git add Project Progress/ADAPT-CamelDEV.md git_helper.py check_git_status.py
   - git commit -m "Update project progress, add Git status check scripts"
2. Push the new commit to the remote repository
3. Verify the successful push of changes
4. Review and update the model integration code:
   - github_model.py
   - gemini_model.py
   - model_factory.py
5. Implement error handling and logging for the new model integrations
6. Create unit tests for the GitHub and Gemini model integrations
7. Update project documentation with new model options and usage instructions

## Action Items
- [ ] Retry staging and committing modified and new files
- [ ] Push new commit to remote repository
- [ ] Verify successful push of changes
- [ ] Review and update model integration code
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Update project documentation

## Notes
We encountered some issues with our initial attempt to stage and commit changes. We will retry this process and ensure all changes are properly pushed to the remote repository before proceeding with further development tasks.

This document will be continuously updated as the project progresses.
