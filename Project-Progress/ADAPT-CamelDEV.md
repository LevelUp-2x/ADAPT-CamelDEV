## Current Status
We have successfully integrated GitHub Models and Google's Gemini models into the ADAPT framework, including multi-modal capabilities. The model factory has been updated to support these new model types, and comprehensive unit tests have been implemented. We have optimized the performance of both GitHub and Gemini model backends by implementing caching, connection pooling, and rate limiting. System-wide tests have been updated to include performance measurements and multi-modal capability tests. We have also created a benchmarking tool for systematic comparison of different model backends, including their multi-modal operations. All documentation has been updated to reflect these new features and capabilities.
