# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

[Previous content remains unchanged up to the Completed Tasks section]

## Completed Tasks
[Previous tasks remain unchanged]
- Created a requirements.txt file listing all project dependencies
- Set up a .env.template file for API key configuration
- Updated the main README.md with information about the testing process and environment setup
- Created run_tests.py script for executing all test suites in the project
- Updated README.md with instructions on how to use the new run_tests.py script
- Implemented basic_agent.py in the langchain_integration folder to showcase LangChain integration
- Created test_basic_agent.py to ensure the functionality of the basic LangChain agent

## Next Steps
1. Schedule a brainstorming session with Georgie and the team to discuss new ideas in detail
2. Prioritize the proposed enhancements and new features
3. Create a roadmap for implementing these ideas over the next development cycles
4. Clone and set up LangChain, LangChain.js, LangGraph, and LangServe repositories
5. Further integrate LangChain's core functionalities into the ADAPT framework
6. Develop more sophisticated prototype agents using LangChain's agent architectures (e.g., ReAct, Plan-and-Execute)
7. Adapt CAMEL's dialogue system to work with LangChain agents
8. Create additional example scripts demonstrating the use of LangChain agents in ADAPT
9. Update documentation to include comprehensive LangChain integration guides and best practices
10. Implement and test multi-agent scenarios using LangChain and CAMEL
11. Begin implementation of new strategic directions (e.g., dynamic agent hierarchies, multi-modal reasoning)
