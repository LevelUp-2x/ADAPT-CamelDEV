# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

## Project Overview
- Project Name: ADAPT-CamelDEV
  - ADAPT: Advanced Dynamic Agent Platform Technology
- Company: LevelUp 2x
- Project Manager: Chase
- Team: TeamADAPT

Our team is committed to using best practices, maintaining thorough documentation, and striving for excellence in all aspects of our work on the Advanced Dynamic Agent Platform Technology (ADAPT) project.

## Team Members
- CAMSTER (Project Lead and AI Assistant)
- Langy (Developer)

## Current Status
We have successfully integrated GitHub Models and Google's Gemini models into the ADAPT framework, including multi-modal capabilities and LangChain integration. The project documentation has been thoroughly updated to reflect these new features. We have created comprehensive testing and benchmarking scripts, including a test execution plan and a script to automate the test execution process and collect results.

## Completed Tasks
- Implemented the AdaptModelBackend abstract base class
- Implemented the GitHubModelBackend and GeminiModelBackend classes
- Created LangChain wrappers for GitHub and Gemini models
- Implemented prompt management and conversation memory systems
- Developed examples showcasing LangChain integration and advanced usage
- Updated the model factory to support GitHub and Gemini models
- Created comprehensive unit tests and system-wide tests
- Implemented benchmarking tools for model backend comparison
- Enhanced error handling and response validation
- Updated user documentation and architectural documentation
- Optimized performance for GitHub and Gemini model backends
- Created separate test files for system tests and LangChain integration
- Developed a comprehensive test execution plan (test_execution_plan.md)
- Created a script to automate test execution and result collection (execute_tests_and_collect_results.py)

## Next Steps
1. Set up the testing environment:
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed
   - Configure API keys for GitHub and Gemini models
2. Execute the test suite using the execute_tests_and_collect_results.py script
3. Analyze test and benchmark results, identifying areas for further optimization
4. Implement additional optimizations based on the analysis
5. Integrate the new model backends and LangChain capabilities with existing CAMEL agents and workflows
6. Develop more advanced examples showcasing the integration of multi-modal capabilities with CAMEL agents
7. Implement more sophisticated AI agent hierarchies using the new LangChain integration
8. Explore possibilities for enhancing the ADAPT framework with more advanced multi-modal interactions
9. Conduct user testing and gather feedback on the new model integrations and LangChain capabilities
10. Prepare for a beta release of the updated ADAPT-CamelDEV framework
