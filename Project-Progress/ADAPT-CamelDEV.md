# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

## Recent Updates

1. Implemented health check endpoints:
   - Added /health endpoint to main application, RAG service, Graph RAG service, and Agent Memory service
   - Updated test_docker_deployment.sh script to test health checks for all services

2. Enhanced Docker deployment testing:
   - Updated test_docker_deployment.sh to include tests for basic functionality (query, document ingestion, memory retrieval)

3. Implemented environment variable management:
   - Created a .env file to store all sensitive information and configuration variables
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to use environment variables from .env file
   - Ensured that sensitive information is not hard-coded in any project files

4. Enhanced containerization:
   - Updated Dockerfiles for each service (main app, RAG, Graph RAG, and Agent Memory)
   - Modified docker-compose.yml to pass environment variables to containers
   - Improved the project structure to accommodate Docker files and environment variables

5. Implemented configuration management system:
   - Created `config.py` for centralized configuration management
   - Updated all microservices to use the new configuration system
   - Modified the main application to utilize the new configuration
   - Updated the start script to use environment-specific configurations

6. Enhanced service discovery:
   - Updated `service_discovery.py` to use the new configuration system
   - Integrated service discovery in all microservices and the main application

7. Improved error handling and logging:
   - Added more comprehensive error handling in all services
   - Implemented logging for better debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Execute and refine Docker deployment tests:
   - Run the test_docker_deployment.sh script
   - Analyze results and fix any issues that arise
   - Refine tests as needed based on results

2. Enhance testing strategy:
   - Develop unit tests for each service
   - Implement integration tests for the entire system
   - Create performance tests to ensure system scalability

3. Implement authentication and authorization:
   - Design and implement a secure authentication system
   - Set up role-based access control for different parts of the application

4. Further improve user interface:
   - Add more advanced features like result filtering and sorting
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets

5. Optimize performance:
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequent queries
   - Optimize database queries and indexing

6. Implement data persistence:
   - Set up a database to store documents, embeddings, and graph data
   - Implement backup and recovery mechanisms

7. Enhance Agent Memory Service:
   - Implement more sophisticated memory management techniques
   - Integrate memory with RAG and Graph RAG services for improved context-aware responses

8. Implement monitoring and alerting:
   - Set up a monitoring system for all services
   - Implement alerts for critical errors or performance issues

9. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation for each service
   - Create detailed setup and running instructions for the Docker environment
   - Develop user guides and system architecture documentation
