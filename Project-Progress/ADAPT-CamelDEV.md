# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

[Previous content remains unchanged]

## Current Status
We have successfully integrated GitHub Models and Google's Gemini models into the ADAPT framework. The model factory has been updated to support these new model types, and comprehensive unit tests have been implemented. User documentation has been created to guide developers in using these new model options. We have also optimized the performance of both GitHub and Gemini model backends, updated the main README.md file with information about the new integrations, and successfully run system-wide tests to ensure proper integration.

## Completed Tasks
[Previous completed tasks remain unchanged]
- Ran system-wide tests using test_adapt_with_new_models.py, which passed successfully

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a comprehensive code review to ensure consistency and best practices across the project
2. Develop more advanced examples and use cases showcasing the new model integrations
3. Explore possibilities for enhancing the ADAPT framework with multi-modal capabilities
4. Implement additional model backends as needed (e.g., other LLM providers)
5. Consider performance optimizations based on the results of system-wide tests
