Subject: Updated GitHub Onboarding Process and Team Structure

Dear Team ADAPT,

I am pleased to announce that we have updated and streamlined our GitHub onboarding process. This update aims to make it easier for team members to get started with our GitHub setup and understand our collaboration practices.

## Key Updates

1. **Simplified Authentication**: Team members are already authenticated as ADAPT-Chase and do not need to perform any additional authentication steps.

2. **ADAPT-Team Creation**: We have created the ADAPT-Team within our LevelUp-2x GitHub organization. This team structure will help manage permissions and collaboration more effectively.

3. **Updated Documentation**: We've revised our onboarding guide and created a new best practices document.

4. **Local Resources**: We've updated links to point to local resources, ensuring that you have easy access to all necessary documents and guidelines.

## Important Documents

Please familiarize yourself with the following updated documents:

1. [GitHub Onboarding Guide](GitHub_Onboarding.md): This is your primary resource for understanding our GitHub setup and workflow.

2. [ADAPT GitHub Best Practices](ADAPT_GitHub_Best_Practices.md): This new document outlines our GitHub best practices and guidelines.

3. [Team ADAPT Coding Standards](LevelUp-2x_ADAPT_Coding_Standards.md): This document outlines our coding standards and best practices.

4. [Git Cheat Sheet](../../docs/GitHub/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf): A quick reference guide for common Git commands.

## Action Items

1. Review the updated [GitHub Onboarding Guide](GitHub_Onboarding.md).
2. Familiarize yourself with our [ADAPT GitHub Best Practices](ADAPT_GitHub_Best_Practices.md).
3. Update your existing projects to align with the new guidelines, if necessary.

## For Team Leads: Managing the ADAPT-Team

If you are a team lead with admin access to the LevelUp-2x organization, please ensure that all team members are added to the ADAPT-Team. To do this:

1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/LevelUp-2x/teams
2. Click on the ADAPT-Team
3. Click on the "Members" tab
4. Use the "Add a member" button to add team members

If you need assistance with this process, please contact the GitHub admin.

## Location of Resources

All the updated documents can be found in the following directory:
- `C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\setup\Onboarding`

If you have any questions or need assistance with the new onboarding process, please don't hesitate to reach out to the team lead or any senior member of the team.

Thank you for your attention to these updates. Your cooperation in following these guidelines will help ensure smooth collaboration and maintain the quality of our projects.

Best regards,
Gitmo
