Task Initialization for DataMaster (Agent 3)
Objective:
Set up a MongoDB database to store and manage data generated by the LLMs, ensuring that it's integrated with the ADAPT-Alpha platform and supports API access for future queries.

Task Details:

Agent Name: DataMaster
Service: Database Setup and Integration
Project: ADAPT-Alpha
Working Directory: C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha
Env File Path: C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\.env
Current Date and Time: [CURRENT_DATETIME]
Expected End Result:

A fully functional MongoDB instance that stores processed data from the GitHub and Gemini LLMs, with API integration for future queries.
Detailed setup and API documentation saved to:
C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\setup\Onboarding\MongoDB_Onboarding.md.
Steps to Completion:

Identify yourself as DataMaster.

MongoDB Setup:

Install MongoDB on the local machine following the setup guide in C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\setup\Onboarding\MongoDB-install.md.
Set the working directory for the database at C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Database.
Database Configuration:

Create a MongoDB database named AdaptLLM_DB.
Inside the database, create collections for:
ProcessedData: For storing LLM outputs.
UserRequests: For tracking user queries to LLMs.
Connection String:

Generate a connection string and add it to the .env file at C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\.env under MONGO_DB_CONN_STRING.
Ensure the database is accessible via the connection string for future API queries.
API Integration:

Create a simple API endpoint using Node.js in the C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\api\mongo-api.js.
The endpoint should allow for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the ProcessedData collection.
Testing:

Test the database connection and API endpoint by storing a sample LLM output in ProcessedData and retrieving it via the API.
Documentation:

Maintain detailed documentation in MongoDB_Setup.md within C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\setup\MongoDB.
Include configuration details and API access instructions.
Onboarding:

Save the onboarding document for future agents in C:\Users\ChaseRemmen\ADAPT\Projects_MAIN\AdaptAI-Alpha\setup\Onboarding\MongoDB_Onboarding.md.
Completion Criteria:

A fully operational MongoDB instance integrated with ADAPT-Alpha, ready to store and retrieve data.
API endpoints for database queries functional and tested.
Comprehensive documentation complete and accessible.
Next Steps After Completion:

Review and ensure database integration is seamless.
Hand off to the next agent if necessary.
Reminder:

Ensure that all data and documentation are properly backed up before completion.# ADAPT GitHub Best Practices

## Introduction

This document outlines the best practices for using GitHub within the ADAPT team. Following these guidelines will help maintain consistency, improve collaboration, and streamline our development process.

## Repository Management

1. Use clear, descriptive names for repositories.
2. Always include a README.md file with project description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
3. Use .gitignore files to exclude unnecessary files and directories.

## Branching Strategy

1. Use feature branches for new features or significant changes.
2. Name branches descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-login-functionality`.
3. Keep the `main` branch stable and deployable at all times.

## Commit Messages

1. Write clear, concise commit messages.
2. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
3. Provide more detailed explanations in the commit body if necessary.

## Pull Requests

1. Create pull requests for all changes to be merged into the main branch.
2. Provide a clear description of the changes in the pull request.
3. Request reviews from at least one other team member.
4. Address all comments and suggestions before merging.

## Code Reviews

1. Be respectful and constructive in code reviews.
2. Focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to team standards.
3. Use GitHub's review features to suggest changes or ask questions.

## Issues

1. Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
2. Provide clear, reproducible steps for bug reports.
3. Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation).

## Documentation

1. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
2. Use markdown for documentation files for better readability on GitHub.

## Security

1. Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys) to the repository.
2. Use environment variables or secure storage for sensitive data.

## Continuous Integration

1. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
2. Ensure all tests pass before merging pull requests.

Remember, these best practices are guidelines to help our team work more effectively. If you have suggestions for improvements, please discuss them with the team.
