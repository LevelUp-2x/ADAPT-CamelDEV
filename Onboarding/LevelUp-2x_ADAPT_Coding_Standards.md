# LevelUp-2x ADAPT Coding Standards

Overview
This document outlines the coding standards to be followed by all developers working on projects within the LevelUp-2x ADAPT platform. These standards ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the entire codebase, while also incorporating best practices for performance, security, and collaboration.

1. General Guidelines
Consistency: Consistency is key. Follow the same coding practices throughout the project, even if working on different modules.
Readability: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Avoid overly complex logic unless absolutely necessary.
Modularity: Break down the code into smaller, reusable modules and functions. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
Documentation: Comment your code where necessary, especially to explain complex logic or assumptions. Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of functions and classes.
2. File and Directory Structure
Project Root: All projects should follow a clear and logical directory structure. For example:

bash
Copy code
project-root/
├── src/            # Source code
├── tests/          # Unit and integration tests
├── docs/           # Documentation files
├── scripts/        # Automation and utility scripts
├── configs/        # Configuration files
├── data/           # Data files
└── logs/           # Log files
Naming Conventions:

Files and Directories: Use snake_case for filenames and directory names.
Classes: Use PascalCase for class names.
Functions and Variables: Use snake_case for function and variable names.
3. Code Style
Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Never use tabs.

Line Length: Keep lines to a maximum of 80 characters. If longer lines are necessary, consider refactoring the code.

Braces:

Use braces in all control structures (if, for, while, etc.), even if they contain a single statement.
Opening braces { should be on the same line as the control structure.
Closing braces } should be aligned with the start of the control structure.
Spacing:

Use spaces around operators (=, +, -, ==, etc.).
Include a space after commas in lists and function arguments.
Place a blank line between functions and classes for readability.
Comments:

Inline Comments: Use inline comments sparingly and only to clarify complex logic. Begin inline comments with a space after the #.
Block Comments: Use block comments to describe the overall function or module. Begin each line of a block comment with #.
4. Python-Specific Standards
Development Environment: Be sure all scripts and programs can run in both PowerShell and Ubuntu in WSL 2, which are the current Dev Environments.

Imports: Group imports into three sections:

Standard Library Imports: e.g., import os
Third-Party Imports: e.g., import requests
Local Imports: e.g., from .module import function
Each group should be separated by a blank line. Order imports alphabetically within each group.

Function and Method Definitions:

Arguments: Always use explicit arguments. Avoid using *args and **kwargs unless necessary.
Return Statements: Include a return statement even if it returns None.
Exception Handling:

Use specific exceptions rather than generic ones (except Exception as e:).
Provide meaningful messages with exceptions, and log exceptions when appropriate.
5. Testing Standards
Test Coverage: Ensure that all new code is covered by unit tests. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
Test Structure: Place tests in the tests/ directory, following the same directory structure as the src/ directory.
Naming: Use test_<function_name>.py for test files and test_<function> for test functions.
CI Integration: Tests should be automatically run as part of the CI pipeline. Ensure that all tests pass before merging any changes.
6. Version Control
Git Usage:

Branches: Use a feature-branch workflow. Name branches according to the feature or issue being worked on, e.g., feature/login-functionality or bugfix/user-auth.
Commits: Write clear, concise commit messages. Follow this structure:
php
Copy code
<type>: <subject>

<body> (optional)
Example:
sql
Copy code
feat: add user authentication

Added JWT-based authentication for user login and registration.
Merging: Use pull requests (PRs) for merging branches into the main branch. All PRs should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

7. Security Best Practices
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) in environment variables. Do not hardcode them in the codebase.
Access Control: Apply the principle of least privilege to all access controls. Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive parts of the project.
Code Review: During code reviews, focus on security implications as well as functionality and performance.
8. Continuous Integration and Deployment
CI/CD Pipelines: All projects should have a CI/CD pipeline set up to automate testing, code analysis, and deployment.
Automation: Automate as much as possible, including deployment scripts, environment setup, and monitoring.
9. Code Review Process
Peer Review: All code must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
Feedback: Provide constructive feedback during reviews. Focus on both improvements and positive aspects.
Approval: Only merge code that has passed all tests and has been approved by a reviewer.
10. Code Performance Optimization
Efficiency: Ensure that code is optimized for performance, particularly in high-traffic or resource-intensive areas. Avoid unnecessary computations, and leverage efficient algorithms and data structures.
Profiling: Use profiling tools to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks. Document the performance improvements and any trade-offs made.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms where applicable to reduce redundant processing. Clearly document the caching strategy.
11. Code Quality Tools
Linters and Formatters: Specify the use of code linters (e.g., pylint, flake8) and formatters (e.g., black) to enforce coding standards automatically. Include the configuration settings for these tools in the project repository.
Static Analysis: Use static code analysis tools (e.g., mypy for type checking) to catch potential errors early. Ensure that the CI pipeline includes static analysis checks.
12. Secure Coding Practices
Input Validation: Implement rigorous input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows. Use well-tested libraries and frameworks for validation.
Authentication and Authorization: Ensure secure handling of authentication and authorization processes. Use libraries that provide encryption and token management, and avoid custom implementations unless necessary.
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Use industry-standard encryption protocols and ensure key management practices are secure.
13. Documentation Best Practices
Comprehensive API Documentation: Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting APIs. Ensure that all endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods are well-documented.
Code Examples: Include examples of how to use functions, classes, and modules within the documentation. This can help new developers quickly understand and integrate with the codebase.
Versioned Documentation: Maintain versioned documentation, so developers can refer to the documentation that matches the version of the code they are working with.
14. Internationalization and Localization
Language Support: Plan for and implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in your codebase, if the project targets multiple regions. This includes text translation, date/time formats, and currency.
Best Practices: Use standardized libraries and methods for internationalization, ensuring that the codebase can easily support additional languages and regions in the future.
15. Dependency Management
Pinned Dependencies: Pin versions of external libraries and dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments. Regularly review and update dependencies to minimize security risks.
Dependency Checks: Use tools like pip-audit or npm audit to automatically check for vulnerabilities in dependencies. Integrate these checks into the CI pipeline.
16. Code Deployment Standards
Deployment Automation: Define a clear process for deployment, including automated scripts and rollback mechanisms. Ensure that deployment scripts are version-controlled and tested.
Environment Parity: Ensure that the development, staging, and production environments are as similar as possible to avoid issues that only appear in production.
Deployment Strategy: Implement a deployment strategy that suits the project’s needs, such as Blue-Green deployments, Canary releases, or Feature Flags.
17. Code Ownership and Documentation
Code Ownership: Clearly define ownership of different modules or components within the codebase. Assign owners for maintaining, reviewing, and improving code.
Knowledge Sharing: Document the ownership structure and ensure that knowledge is shared across the team to prevent bottlenecks and knowledge silos.
Mentorship: Encourage code reviews to be a learning opportunity, where senior developers provide guidance and mentorship to junior developers.
18. Incident Response and Troubleshooting
Error Handling: Implement consistent error handling throughout the codebase. Use custom exception classes where applicable and ensure that errors are logged with enough context to aid in troubleshooting.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring for critical systems and use alerts to notify the team of potential issues. Document common issues and their resolutions in a centralized knowledge base.
Post-Incident Reviews: After an incident, conduct a review to understand the root cause and implement measures to prevent recurrence. Document the findings and share them with the team.
19. Continuous Learning and Improvement
Learning Resources: Encourage continuous learning by providing access to learning resources such as books, online courses, and workshops. Keep the team updated on new tools, frameworks, and practices.
Code Quality Metrics: Track code quality metrics such as code complexity, test coverage, and defect density. Use these metrics to identify areas for improvement and set goals for the team.
Regular Audits: Periodically audit the codebase for adherence to the coding standards, performance, and security. Make improvements based on the audit findings.
20. Collaboration and Communication
Cross-Team Collaboration: Foster collaboration between different teams (e.g., front-end, back-end, DevOps) to ensure that the entire system works seamlessly together.
Code Walkthroughs: Regularly conduct code walkthroughs to keep the team aligned on coding standards, design patterns, and architectural decisions.
Feedback Loops: Establish feedback loops where developers can share insights, challenges, and suggestions for improving the codebase and development processes.
