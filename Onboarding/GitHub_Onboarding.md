## 1. Organization and Team Structure

Our GitHub organization is named "LevelUp-2x". You are already a member of this organization and have been added to the ADAPT-Team. This team structure allows us to manage permissions and collaborate effectively on our projects.

Your GitHub account is set up with the following details:
- Username: ADAPT-Chase
- Email: chase@levelup2x.com

## 2. Cloning and Working with Repositories

To clone a repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LevelUp-2x/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY_NAME
```

You are already authenticated as ADAPT-Chase, so you should be able to clone and work with repositories without any additional steps.

## 3. Workflow: Making Changes

3.1. Make your changes in the code

3.2. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add .
```

3.3. Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

3.4. Push your changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 4. Code Review Best Practices

When reviewing code, follow these best practices:

4.1. Be respectful and constructive in your feedback
4.2. Focus on the code, not the person
4.3. Explain your reasoning, especially for suggested changes
4.4. Look for:
   - Code correctness
   - Performance issues
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Adherence to coding standards
   - Test coverage
4.5. Use inline comments for specific issues
4.6. Provide examples or suggestions for improvement when possible

## 5. Using GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions to automate various tasks, including LLM-based code reviews.

5.1. Viewing workflow runs:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - You'll see a list of all workflow runs

5.2. Understanding the LLM Code Review workflow:
   - The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/llm-code-review.yml`
   - It runs automatically on new pull requests and updates
   - The LLM provides AI-powered code review comments

5.3. Addressing LLM review comments:
   - Treat LLM comments as you would human reviewer comments
   - Implement suggested changes or explain why they're not applicable
   - Commit and push your changes to update the pull request

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, follow these steps:

6.1. Check the GitHub status:
    - Visit [GitHub Status Page](https://www.githubstatus.com/)
    - Look for any ongoing incidents or maintenance

6.2. Review internal documentation:
    - Check the ADAPT repository for known issues and solutions

6.3. Common problems and solutions:
    - Permission denied: Check your team membership and repository access
    - Git conflicts: Pull the latest changes and resolve conflicts locally

If you continue to experience issues, please reach out to the team lead or a senior member of the team for assistance.
