## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)

## Installation

1. Clone the ADAPT repository with all submodules:
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/ADAPT/ADAPT.git
   cd ADAPT
   ```

2. If you've already cloned the repository without `--recursive`, initialize and update submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `config.yaml` with your specific settings (API keys, database connections, etc.)

## Using ADAPT

1. Start the ADAPT platform:
   ```
   python start_adapt.py
   ```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

3. Log in using your credentials

## Sub-projects (Submodules)

ADAPT consists of several sub-projects, each implemented as a Git submodule:

- ADAPT-ADAPTdev: Core development of the ADAPT platform
- Adapt-Confluence: Integration with Atlassian Confluence
- ADAPT-GCP: Google Cloud Platform integration
- ADAPT-Github: GitHub integration and automation
- ADAPT-Jira: Atlassian Jira integration
- ADAPT-Slack: Slack integration for communication
- ADAPT-Terraform: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

### Working with Submodules

To update all submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To work on a specific sub-project:

1. Navigate to the submodule directory:
   ```
   cd <submodule-name>
   ```
2. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```
3. Make your changes, commit, and push to the submodule's repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```
4. Create a pull request in the submodule's repository on GitHub.

### Moving Existing Projects

If you have an existing project that needs to be moved into one of these submodules:

1. Copy your project files into the appropriate submodule directory.
2. Navigate to the submodule directory.
3. Stage, commit, and push your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Move existing project into submodule"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Navigate back to the root of the ADAPT repository.
5. Stage, commit, and push the updated submodule reference:
   ```
   git add <submodule-name>
   git commit -m "Update submodule reference"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs in the `logs/` directory
2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Verify your configuration in `config.yaml`
4. Consult the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for common issues and solutions
