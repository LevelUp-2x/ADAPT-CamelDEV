# ADAPT-CamelDEV Testing Strategy and Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for the ADAPT-CamelDEV project. Our testing approach includes unit tests, integration tests, and plans for performance and load testing.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented for each microservice to ensure individual components function correctly in isolation.

Location: `tests/test_app.py`, `tests/test_rag_service.py`, `tests/test_graph_rag_service.py`, `tests/test_agent_memory_service.py`

To run unit tests:
```
pytest tests/test_app.py tests/test_rag_service.py tests/test_graph_rag_service.py tests/test_agent_memory_service.py
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the correct interaction between different microservices and test the end-to-end flow of the application.

Location: `tests/test_integration.py`

To run integration tests:
```
pytest tests/test_integration.py
```

### 3. Performance and Load Testing (Planned)

We plan to implement performance and load testing to ensure our microservices architecture can handle expected and peak loads.

## Test Environment

Our tests are designed to run in a Docker environment to ensure consistency across different development and deployment environments.

To set up the test environment and run all tests:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

This script will:
- Build and start the Docker containers
- Run all unit and integration tests
- Stop and remove the Docker containers after testing

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We are in the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate our testing and deployment processes. The chosen CI/CD tool and specific pipeline configuration will be documented here once implemented.

## Test Coverage

We aim to maintain high test coverage for our codebase. Coverage reports will be generated as part of our CI/CD pipeline (to be implemented).

## Updating Tests

When adding new features or modifying existing ones:

1. Update or add unit tests to cover the changes.
2. Update integration tests if the changes affect the interaction between services.
3. Run all tests locally using the `run_tests.sh` script before pushing changes.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement performance and load testing.
2. Integrate GUI interface tests with our current testing setup.
3. Set up automated test coverage reporting.
4. Implement end-to-end tests that cover full user scenarios.

This document will be updated as our testing strategy evolves and new procedures are implemented.
