# ADAPT-CamelDEV Project Progress

## 1. Project Overview
The ADAPT-CamelDEV project aims to enhance and adapt the CAMEL (Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Models) platform to work exclusively with the models specified in our .env file. This includes integrating GitHub Models Beta Trial and Google Vertex AI Gemini models into the CAMEL framework, improving its capabilities and flexibility.

## 2. Current Status
We have made progress in implementing the GitHub and Gemini model integrations, but we are currently facing challenges with Git repository management and command execution.

1. GitHub model integration (github_model.py) is implemented and updated to use the correct environment variables.
2. Gemini model integration (gemini_model.py) is implemented and updated to use the correct API keys from the environment.
3. The ModelFactory (model_factory.py) has been updated to incorporate both GitHub and Gemini models.
4. The .env file contains the necessary API keys and endpoints for both GitHub and Gemini models.
5. We are experiencing difficulties in executing Git commands and viewing their output, which is hindering our ability to manage the repository effectively.

## 3. Completed Tasks
- Initialized Git repository
- Created initial project progress file (ADAPT-CamelDEV.md)
- Reviewed existing .env file with model configurations
- Studied onboarding materials in the Onboarding folder
- Updated .gitignore file to include CAMEL_Model_Adaptation directory
- Reviewed existing model implementations (github_model.py and gemini_model.py)
- Examined and updated ModelFactory implementation (model_factory.py)
- Verified .env file contains necessary API keys for GitHub and Gemini models
- Updated GitHub model class to use GITHUB_MODELS_ENDPOINT from environment variables
- Updated Gemini model class to use Gemini_Studio_CHASE_API_KEY with fallback to Gemini_Studio_LIQUIDMOVZ_API_KEY
- Attempted to resolve Git submodule issues with the 'camel' directory

## 4. Next Steps
1. Investigate and resolve issues with Git command execution and output display
2. Once Git issues are resolved, stage and commit all changes
3. Implement error handling and logging for new model interactions
4. Create unit tests for GitHub and Gemini model integrations
5. Update CAMEL's documentation with new model options
6. Perform extensive testing with various prompts and scenarios
7. Optimize performance for new model integrations

## 5. Challenges and Proposed Solutions
- Challenge: Difficulties in executing Git commands and viewing their output
  Solution: Investigate potential issues with the Git installation, terminal configuration, or environment variables
- Challenge: Ensuring correct error handling for API key and endpoint issues
  Solution: Implement robust error checking and informative error messages in both GitHub and Gemini model classes
- Challenge: Ensuring consistent performance across various models
  Solution: Implement benchmarking tools and optimize prompts for each model type

## 6. Improvement Suggestions
- Develop a configuration management system for easy model switching
- Create a CLI tool for model selection and testing
- Implement a plugin architecture for future model integrations
- Establish a more robust documentation backup and version control system
- Implement a more structured approach to managing the project's directory structure and Git configuration

## 7. Integration with ADAPT Platform
- Ensure compatibility with other ADAPT components
- Regular communication with team members on integration requirements
- Consider creating interfaces for standardized interactions with other ADAPT modules

## Documentation and Collaboration
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in this file and other relevant locations
- Regular commits to the LevelUp-2x/ADAPT-CamelDEV GitHub repository (once Git issues are resolved)
- Establish code review process with team members
