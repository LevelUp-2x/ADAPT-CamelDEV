# Welcome to CAMEL‚Äôs documentation!#

We design **practical** artificial general intelligence.

**CAMEL** emerges as the earliest [LLM-based multi-agent
framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17760.pdf), and is now a generic
framework to build and use LLM-based agents for real-world task solving. We
believe that studying these agents on a large scale offers valuable insights
into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential risks. To facilitate
research in this field, we implement and support various types of agents,
tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.

## Get Involved#

We are always happy to work with friends to continuously move forward with our
own competitive edges.

**For Research Aficionados** : New, rigorous and in-depth research takes time
and resources. With access to almost unlimited usage of advanced GPU computes
and a team of amazing researchers and engineers, we are bold enough to explore
the frontier with patience. Whether you would like to join in our on-going
project or have new idea to test, feel free to talk to us and see how we may
work together.

**For Coding Enthusiasts** : Whether you want to introduce new features,
enhance the infrastructure, improve documentation, asking issues, add more
examples, implement state-of-the-art research ideas, or fix bugs, we
appreciate each and every commit. Get started by checking out the
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/wiki/Contributing-
Guidlines) on GitHub.

**For Interested Humans** : Connect with us on
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/camel-
ai/shared_invite/zt-2g7xc41gy-_7rcrNNAArIP6sLQqldkqQ) or
