# Testing Environment Setup Guide for ADAPT-CamelDEV

This guide outlines the steps to set up the testing environment for the ADAPT-CamelDEV project. Following these steps will ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and configurations in place to run the comprehensive test suite.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/ADAPT-CamelDEV.git
cd ADAPT-CamelDEV
```

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Set Up API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

```
GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_github_api_key_here` and `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

## Step 5: Install Additional Testing Dependencies

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

## Step 6: Verify Installation

Run the following commands to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python -c "import camel; print(camel.__version__)"
python -c "import langchain; print(langchain.__version__)"
pytest --version
```

These commands should print the versions of CAMEL, LangChain, and pytest without any errors.

## Step 7: Configure Test Settings

If necessary, update the `ADAPT-CamelDEV-Project/tests/conftest.py` file with any specific test configurations or fixtures.

## Step 8: Prepare Test Data

If your tests require specific data files or configurations, make sure they are in place in the appropriate directories.

## Running the Tests

Now that your environment is set up, you can run the tests using the `execute_tests_and_collect_results.py` script:

```bash
python ADAPT-CamelDEV-Project/execute_tests_and_collect_results.py
```

This script will run all the tests and benchmarks, and collect the results in a timestamped directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or test execution:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and up to date.
2. Check that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
3. Verify that you're running the commands from the root directory of the project.
4. If specific tests are failing, check the error messages and traceback for clues about what might be wrong.

For any persistent issues, please contact the project maintainers or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

Following this guide should provide you with a fully set up testing environment for the ADAPT-CamelDEV project. Remember to keep your testing environment up to date as the project evolves, and always use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
